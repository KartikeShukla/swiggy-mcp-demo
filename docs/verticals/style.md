# Vertical: style (StyleKit)

## Goal

Grooming/skincare/haircare recommendations + Instamart product/cart flow.

## Primary Paths

1. gather concern and type context
2. suggest routine/product set
3. fetch product cards
4. compare and build cart
5. explicit checkout confirmation

## Key Edge Cases

1. skincare vs haircare context branch
2. vague user goals
3. brand unavailable fallback
4. budget vs premium recommendation branch
